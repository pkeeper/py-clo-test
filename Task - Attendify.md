## Task

You have to create a tool to calculate Dribbble stats:

1. For a given Dribbble user find all followers
2. For each follower find all shots
3. For each shot find all "likers"
4. Calculate Top10 "likers"

## Questions to think about

1. How to deal with Dribbble API Limits?
2. What if we have a server that respond to incoming requests instead of CLI tool?
3. What if I want to stop process and restart from a some kind of "savepoint"?
4. Futures VS. Async VS. Streaming VS. Deferreds VS. "you-name-it"?
5. How to use systems like Storm OR Summingbird OR Spark OR Onyx to solve tasks like this?
